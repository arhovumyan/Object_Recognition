## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Activate Environment
```bash
cd /home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run Real-Time Phone Detection
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash

```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Run It

### 📷 **Camera Opens**
- Automatically opens `/dev/video0` (or specified camera)
- Sets resolution to 640x480 at 30 FPS
- Starts publishing video stream

### 🔍 **YOLO Detection**
- Detects objects in real-time
- **Focuses on phones** with lower confidence threshold (0.3)
- Highlights phones with **yellow bounding boxes**
- Logs detection statistics

### 🧠 **MobileNet Classification**
- Takes detected objects and classifies them
- **Specifically identifies phones** with high accuracy
- Uses lower threshold (0.15) for better phone detection
- Highlights confirmed phones with **bright yellow boxes**

### 📹 **Video Recording**
- Automatically saves video to `recordings/` folder
- Filename: `detection_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`
- Records all detection results with bounding boxes

### 📊 **Real-Time Logs**

## 📡 Monitor Topics

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Check system status
ros2 topic echo /recognition_status

# Monitor phone detections
ros2 topic echo /target_object_found

# View detection results
ros2 topic echo /object_detections

# View classification results
ros2 topic echo /object_classification
```

### Debug Images
```bash
# View YOLO detection visualization
rqt_image_view /yolo_debug_image

# View classification visualization
rqt_image_view /classification_debug_image
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 📷 **Camera Not Found**
```bash
# Check available cameras
ls /dev/video*

# Try different camera device
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition realtime_phone_detection.launch.py camera_device:=/dev/video1
```

### 🐌 **Low Performance**
```bash
# Lower FPS for better performance
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition realtime_phone_detection.launch.py fps:=15

# Lower resolution
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition realtime_phone_detection.launch.py \
    camera_width:=320 camera_height:=240
```

### 📱 **Phone Detection Issues**
```bash
# Lower thresholds for more sensitive detection
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition realtime_phone_detection.launch.py \

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

✅ **Camera opens successfully**  
✅ **"Video recording started" message**  
✅ **Yellow boxes appear around phones**  
✅ **"📱 PHONE DETECTED" messages in logs**  
✅ **Statistics showing phone detection rate**  
✅ **Video files saved in recordings folder**  

## 🔄 System Architecture

```
USB Camera → YOLO Detection → MobileNet Classification → Video Recording
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Live Feed → Phone Candidates → Phone Confirmation → Saved Video
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Point your camera at a phone** and watch the detection!
2. **Check the recordings folder** for saved videos
3. **Monitor the logs** for phone detection messages
4. **Adjust thresholds** if needed for your specific use case

## 🚁 Drone Integration

The system publishes target positions that can be used for drone navigation:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /target_position
```

Use this data to control your drone's movement toward detected phones!
