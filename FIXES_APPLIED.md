# üîß Fixes Applied to ROS2 Object Recognition System

## Summary
Fixed critical errors preventing the ROS2 launch system from working properly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ CUDA Compatibility Error
**Problem:** 
```
CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device
```

**Root Cause:** 
The RTX 5070 Laptop GPU has CUDA capability sm_120, but PyTorch was compiled for older architectures (sm_50 to sm_90). This caused runtime CUDA errors during inference.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive GPU compatibility check at startup that tests actual inference
- Implemented graceful fallback to CPU mode when GPU errors occur
- Enhanced error handling to catch CUDA errors during model inference
- Added proper logging for both ROS2 and standalone modes

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `src/live_object_detection.py`:
  - Enhanced `setup_model()` with actual inference test
  - Improved error handling in `run_detection_cycle()` with better exception catching
  - Added support for both ROS2 logger and print statements

### 2. ‚úÖ RCL Shutdown Error
**Problem:**
```
rclpy._rclpy_pybind11.RCLError: failed to shutdown: rcl_shutdown already called on the given context
```

**Root Cause:**
When ROS2 launch system sends SIGINT, it shuts down the context globally, but the individual nodes also try to call `rclpy.shutdown()` in their cleanup, causing a double-shutdown error.

**Solution:**
Added protection against double-shutdown in both nodes:

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `src/live_object_detection.py`:
  ```python
  # Protect against double shutdown
  try:
      if rclpy.ok():
          rclpy.shutdown()
  except Exception as e:
      pass  # Ignore shutdown errors
  ```

- Updated `src/camera_publisher_node.py`:
  ```python
  # Protect against double shutdown
  try:
      if rclpy.ok():
          rclpy.shutdown()
  except Exception as e:
      pass  # Ignore shutdown errors
  ```

### 3. ‚úÖ Launch File Executable Name
**Problem:**
Launch file was trying to execute `ros2_detection_node.py` which doesn't exist.

**Solution:**
Updated launch file to use the correct executable `live_object_detection.py` with proper `--ros-args` argument.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `ros2_ws/src/drone_object_recognition/launch/object_recognition.launch.py`

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå CUDA errors flooded the console
- ‚ùå Nodes crashed with RCLError on shutdown
- ‚ùå Launch file couldn't find executable

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ No CUDA errors - gracefully falls back to CPU
- ‚úÖ No shutdown errors - clean exit
- ‚úÖ Launch file works correctly
- ‚úÖ Both nodes start successfully
- ‚úÖ System runs on CPU mode automatically

## Running the System

```bash
cd /home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition object_recognition.launch.py
```

## Notes

### Camera Requirement
The system requires a connected camera. If no camera is available:
- Camera publisher node will log an error but continue running
- Object detection node will show warnings about failed frame grabs
- To work around this, you can:
  - Connect a USB webcam
  - Use `use_camera_node:=false` and provide camera feed from another source
  - Modify the code to use a test video file

### GPU Status
The system detects that the RTX 5070 GPU is incompatible with the current PyTorch installation and automatically uses CPU mode. To enable GPU:
1. Reinstall PyTorch compiled for sm_120 (CUDA 12.4+)
2. Follow instructions at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## Files Modified

1. `/home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/src/live_object_detection.py`
2. `/home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/src/camera_publisher_node.py`
3. `/home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/ros2_ws/src/drone_object_recognition/launch/object_recognition.launch.py`

**Note:** The files in `/home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/src/` are the master copies. They have been copied to the ROS2 workspace and built.
