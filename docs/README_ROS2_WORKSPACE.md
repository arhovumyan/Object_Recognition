# ROS2 Workspace Organization

## 📁 New Structure

The ROS2 workspace has been moved inside the ObjectRec folder for better organization:

```
ObjectRec/
├── live_object_detection.py          # Main unified script
├── live_object_detection_jetson.py   # Jetson-optimized version
├── camera_publisher_node.py          # ROS2 camera node
├── package.xml                       # ROS2 package definition
├── CMakeLists.txt                    # Build configuration
├── launch/                           # ROS2 launch files
│   └── object_recognition.launch.py
├── models/                           # AI model files
│   ├── yolov8n.pt
│   └── yolov8s.pt

└── tools/                            # Setup and utility scripts
```

## 🚀 How to Use the ROS2 Workspace

### 1. Navigate to the workspace:
```bash
cd /home/aro/Documents/ObjectRec/ros2_ws
```

### 2. Build the package:
```bash
colcon build --packages-select drone_object_recognition
```

### 3. Source the workspace:
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

### 4. Run the system:
```bash
# Launch the complete ROS2 system
ros2 launch drone_object_recognition object_recognition.launch.py

# Or run the unified script as a ROS2 node
ros2 run drone_object_recognition live_object_detection.py --ros-args
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Organization

- ✅ **Everything in one place** - No need to navigate between different directories
- ✅ **Self-contained project** - Easy to copy/move the entire ObjectRec folder
- ✅ **Cleaner structure** - ROS2 workspace is part of the project
- ✅ **Version control friendly** - Everything is in the same repository

## 🔧 Quick Commands

From the ObjectRec directory:

```bash
# Build ROS2 package
cd ros2_ws && colcon build --packages-select drone_object_recognition

# Test standalone mode
python3 live_object_detection.py

# Test Jetson mode
python3 live_object_detection_jetson.py
```
